<p>Church Rd is a short but very sweet climb. 
  Starting at the small but perfectly-formed green of Grafty Green itself, take the left turn to pass the tiny village hall on your right - which was promoting a pancake day feast when I passed - then a quick descent into farmland before a brief steepish section (a chevron, apparently, but with the momentum from the descent it doesnâ€™t feel like one). Then a left curve gives you a magnificent view of the valley below - continue past the beautiful church to climb to the crossroads, then turn back, sit on the south-facing bench outside the church, have a bite and a swig and chat to the sheep. </p>
